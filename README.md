#@ Project Description

`This project is primarily built using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and GraphQL. Express npm package is primarily used for bootstraping http server and GraphQL is used for creating Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions for backend API. There is only one end point which is http://localhost:5000 for this project for building API.`

`This project is just an exposure to learn and leverage the benefits of GraphQL over legacy REST API. Later this project can be leveraged into building a powerful backend service. Feel free to clone or fork this project for your own purpose.`
